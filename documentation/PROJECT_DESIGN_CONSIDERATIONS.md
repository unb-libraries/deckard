# Project Questionnaire

## What (generic) questions do you envision asking the LLM?

## Who usually asks these questions?

## Could the questions be grouped into conceptual 'sets'?

For each conceptual set:

### Is there a one or more 'data sets' that can help the LLM answer more accurately?
### What Format is the 'data set' in?
### Does the 'data set' contain content written at UNB Libraries?
### If not, was it curated at UNB Libraries?
### What are 25 sample questions you envision this tool would answer?
### What responses should the LLM NOT generate?
